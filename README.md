I created this project with the goal of dedicating it to my girlfriend and also to experiment with making a "game" in the style of "shoot 'em up," themed around Kuromi and My Melody since they are some of my favorite characters. I hope to continue learning much more about design and programming so that in the future I can focus on creating bigger projects, P.S. I love my girlfriend very much.
